# RealmTwitterExample
Delayed posts and updates to Twitter timeline, using Realm as storage

## Post-Clone Setup
If you're uncomfortable with submodules, running `scripts/setup.sh` should help you get going.

## Test Account Recommended
This example will post timestamp tweets to whatever Twitter account you choose via iOS Settings. Unless you want this in your personal Twitter account, you should setup a test account to hold this information.
