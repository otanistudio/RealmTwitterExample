# RealmTwitterExample
Delayed posts and updates to Twitter timeline, using Realm as storage. I'm using this as a live demo presentation of how the basics works in context of async networking, and delayed spooler-type uploads, with reads and writes in different threads to update table section data.

## Post-Clone Setup
If you're uncomfortable with submodules, running `scripts/setup.sh` should help you get going.

## Test Account Recommended
This example will post timestamp tweets to whatever Twitter account you choose via iOS Settings. Unless you want this in your personal Twitter account, you should setup a test account to hold this information.
